The Exoplanet Archive is a comprehensive database that provides a wealth of information on exoplanets that have been discovered beyond our solar system. This dataset has been collated from various sources, including NASA's space missions, ground-based observatories, and other reliable sources. It contains detailed information such as the name, mass, radius, distance from its host star, and other physical characteristics of each exoplanet, as well as information on the host star, such as its name, mass, and radius.

This database is an essential resource for astronomers interested in studying the properties and distribution of exoplanets in our galaxy. By providing this information in an accessible and user-friendly format, this dataset can help researchers identify trends and patterns in exoplanet data that may lead to new discoveries and insights into the origins of our universe. The archive is updated regularly as new exoplanets are discovered, ensuring that the most up-to-date information is always available to users.
